The first section of the notebook aims to reproduce the results of the paper "Identifying keystone species in microbial communities using deep learning" by Wang et al, published in Nature Ecology and Evolution. They present a Neural ODE cNODE2 that aims to take a binary vector of whether a species is present in a sample or not and map it to a relative abundance. They validate their model using simulated Lotka-Volterra data.
